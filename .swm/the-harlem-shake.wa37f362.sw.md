The **Harlem shake** is a style of [hip-hop dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip-hop_dance "Hip-hop dance") and is characterized by jerky arm and shoulder movements in time to music.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-1) The dance was created by Harlem resident Al B. (Albert Boyce) in 1981; the dance was initially called "The Albee" or "The Al. B.".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-2) As indicated by the name, it is associated with the predominantly [African-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans "African Americans") neighborhood of [Harlem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem "Harlem"), in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-:0-3) The dance became known as the Harlem Shake as its prominence grew beyond the neighborhood. In 2001 [G. Dep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Dep "G. Dep")'s music video for the song "Let's Get It" introduced the dance to the mainstream.

&nbsp;

The dance was created Al B. who was known for performing it during breaks at the [Entertainer's Basketball Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainer%27s_Basketball_Classic "Entertainer's Basketball Classic") basketball tournament at [Rucker Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rucker_Park "Rucker Park").[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-4) Harlem resident Al B. (also known as Ali Saadat and Al Cisco), whose legal name was Albert Leopold Boyce, died in 2006 at the age of 43.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-:1-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-insidehoops-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-7) The dance was first called "The Albee" after its creator and later became known at the Harlem Shake when it became popular outside of the neighbourhood.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-:2-8) The dance was then popularised by four man dance crew Crazy Boyz (members Maurice "Motion" Strayhorn, Jesse "Smiley" Rutland,[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-14) Kirkland "Dirty Kirt" Young and Joseph "No Bones" Collins).[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-Gregory-15)

Sources differ in identifying the inspiration for the dance - some say it is based on an [Ethiopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "Ethiopia") dance [Eskista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskista "Eskista")[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-:0-3)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-16) and others that it was inspired by the dance moves of the creator's mother Sandra Boyce.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-:1-5)

In 2003 interview Al B. said that the dance is "It's a drunken shake anyway, it's an alcoholic shake, but it's fantastic, everybody loves it and everybody appreciates it. And it's glowing with glory. And it's respected." According to Al. B. the dance came from the [ancient Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") and describes it as what the mummies used to do.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-:2-8)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-insidehoops-6) Because they were all wrapped up, they couldn't really move, all they could do was shake.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-dancejam-17)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-18)

## In popular culture\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harlem_shake_\(dance\)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: In popular culture")\]

The Harlem Shake became mainstream in 2001 with the release of the music video for "Let's Get It" by [G. Dep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Dep "G. Dep"). The video featured children performing the dance.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-19)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-dancejam-17)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-20) The dance became popular in hip-hop music videos of the era especially with artists from Harlem. Most notably it was a key feature in music videos for [Jadakiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadakiss "Jadakiss")' "Put Your Hands Up and G.Dep's "Special Delivery", both released in 2001.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-21) The outro to [Missy Elliott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missy_Elliott "Missy Elliott")'s 2002 hit "[Work It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_It_\(Missy_Elliott_song\) "Work It (Missy Elliott song)")" states "Yo, it's okay though, you know if you wanna be hard and ice-grilled, and Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever, let's just have fun." The Harlem Shake was also referenced in the lyrics to the song "Down and Out" by Harlem rapper [Cam'ron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam%27ron "Cam'ron").

The Harlem Shake is commonly associated with a similar dance move "The Chicken Noodle Soup". The "[Chicken Noodle Soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Noodle_Soup_\(Webstar_song\) "Chicken Noodle Soup (Webstar song)")" dance evolved from the Harlem Shake and exploded into popularity in the summer of 2006 when [DJ Webstar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Webstar "DJ Webstar") and Young B brought it to the mainstream with the release of a song of the same name.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-dancejam-17)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-22) The dance is referred to in the [CunninLynguists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CunninLynguists "CunninLynguists") song "Old School", in [Mac Dre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Dre "Mac Dre")'s "Thizzle Dance," and in [Nelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly "Nelly")'s "Dilemma." A band from New York City took the name of the dance and dubbed themselves [Harlem Shakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Shakes "Harlem Shakes").

### **eaction to the Harlem shake meme and song\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harlem_shake_\(dance\)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Reaction to the Harlem shake meme and song")\]**

*Main articles: [Harlem shake (meme)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(meme\) "Harlem shake (meme)") and [Harlem Shake (song)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Shake_\(song\) "Harlem Shake (song)")*

In February 2013, a song named "[Harlem Shake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Shake_\(song\) "Harlem Shake (song)")" (due to a sampled line referring to the Harlem Shake dance), originally released by [Baauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baauer "Baauer") in May 2012, went viral and became an [Internet meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme "Internet meme") after featuring in a [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") video by [DizastaMusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joji_\(musician\) "Joji (musician)"), primarily known as Pink Guy or FilthyFrank at the time, who is now known as Joji. The dance that is done on the internet as a meme is not the Harlem Shake.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-23) A number of Harlem residents were displeased with the co-opting of the name and making a mockery of the dance. Harlemite Elaine Caesar was quoted as saying "Don’t offend us with that nonsense you’re calling the Harlem Shake." The meme was described as "cultural gentrification" and cultural appropriation.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-24)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-25) The meme inspired a number of videos demonstrating authentic dance.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_shake_\(dance\)#cite_note-Gregory-15)
