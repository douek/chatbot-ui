# Chocolate Milkshake

&nbsp;

Make sure to use high-quality ingredients. Whole milk will give the richest taste; a quality full-fat ice cream made with a few simple ingredients (no additives or thickeners) will add silky texture; and good chocolate syrup will give your shake the perfect flavor. Use nice dark or milk chocolate for the shavings.

Use our recipe as a milkshake base and add other toppings, like crushed cookies, toasted marshmallows, or candy bars. Check out all our suggestions below.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups vanilla ice cream

- 1/2 cup whole milk, cold

- 1/4 cup chocolate syrup

- 1/4 cup chocolate chips, optional

- Whipped cream, garnish

- Shaved chocolate, garnish

Place the ice cream, milk, and chocolate syrup into the blender. If using chocolate chips, add those as well. Be mindful that the harder the ice cream is, the better, as the blending process can liquefy the ice cream too much and make the milkshake too thin.

&nbsp;

Blend the ingredients until completely smooth.

&nbsp;

Pour into your glasses immediately, top with whipped cream, and decorate with shaved chocolate. Enjoy!

### **What to Do With Leftover Milkshake?**

Although unlikely, you might have some extra milkshake in your blender. Milkshake doesn't keep well after it has been blended because it will lose its texture. Instead of throwing it away:

- Fill ice pop molds with the delicious concoction. Freeze and enjoy at any time.

- Freeze the leftovers in an ice cube tray and blend those again with additional milk when ready for another sweet treat.

&nbsp;

### **How Can I Thicken a Milkshake?**

If you like a very thick, eat-with-a-spoon kind of milkshake, remember to:

- Add ice when blending the ingredients.

- Always use full-fat ingredients.

- Replace half of the milk with heavy cream.

- Replace the chocolate syrup with fudge.

- Add a frozen banana into the mix.
